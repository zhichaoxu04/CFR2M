CFR2M:
================

The [CFR2M](https://github.com/zhichaoxu04/CFR2M) `R` package construct confidence intervals based on the newly-derived closed-form asymptotic distribution of the R-squared measure.
To avoid potential bias, we perform iterative Sure Independence Screening (iSIS) and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in two subsamples to exclude the non-mediators, followed by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for the variance estimation.
