CFR2M:
================

The [CFR2M](https://github.com/zhichaoxu04/CFR2M) `R` package facilitates the execution of the crSKAT method, which stands for Interval-Censored Sequence Kernel Association Test with competing risks outcomes. Additionally, it handles the interval-censored Burden test considering competing risks. This tool is especially valuable for conducting analyses on feature sets in genetic association research, like evaluating all SNPs within a specific gene or pathway.
