Description: The CFR2M package constructs confidence intervals based on the newly-derived closed-form asymptotic distribution of the R-squared measure. To avoid potential bias, we perform iterative Sure Independence Screening (iSIS) and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in two subsamples to exclude the non-mediators, followed by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for the variance estimation.
